-->Linux OS came into market in the year of 1991.
-->Linux OS developed by one student his name is "Linus Torvalds"
-->Linux OS is free & open source code.
-->So many people taken Linux OS source code and re-designed it and released into market with thier brand names(These are called as Linux Distributions)
-->Linux having more than 200 distributions
    1.Ubuntu
    2.Cent OS
    3.RHEL
    4.Fedora
    5.Suse
    6.Kali linux etc
-->Linux is multi userbased operating system
-->Linux OS is highly secured when compared with windows OS.

Linux Architecture:-
----------------------------------
-->Hardware consists all the physical devices attached to the system
   Example:-Hard disc, RAM, mother board and CPU.
-->Kernal is the core component of linux OS, which will intract with hardware directly
-->Shell is the interface which takes input from the user and send instructions to kernal and takes output from kernal and sends to user.
-->Applications are the utilities which runs on the shell
   Example:-Browser, text editor and media player.

Linux File System:-
-------------------------

-->In linux everything will be treated as file only
-->All the files in linux OS are divided into 3 types
   1)Ordinary files
   2)Directory files
   3)Device Files
-->The files which contains data directly are called as ordinary files.
   Ex:-Text files, binary files(images, audios & videos)
-->Directory files in linux nothing but folders in windows
-->In linux every device will be represented as a file. By using device files we can communicate with the devices.

How to check file type in Linux?
------------------------------------
To display all files with it is type we will use ls -l command

d :Represents directory file
- :Ordinary files
l :Represents link file

To create an file:- touch filename.extension
                    touch f3.txt

To create an directory:- mkdir directoryname
                         mkdir linux

To remove directory:- rmdir directoryname

To print the present working directory:- pwd

To print account user:- whoami

To list down the files:- ls -l

To change directory 
     To come back cd ..  (cd ../..)
     To forward cd directoryname

To clear data from the terminal:- clear

We can use several options with ls command
----------------------------------------------
ls:- It will display all files & directories in alphabetical order
ls -r :- It will display all files & directories in reverse of alphabetical order
ls | more :-It will display files & directories names in line by line.
ls -t :- It will display files based on last modified date and time. Most recent files will be displayed on top and old files will be displayed at bottom.
ls -lt

Note:- We can execute command with multiple options also
Example:-
ls -lt

->ls -ltr :- It will display long listing files based on lastmodified date and time in reverse (old files will display at top and recent files will show at bottom)
->ls -la :-It will display hidden files.
->ls -A :-It will display all files along with hidden files except . and .. files
->ls -F :- It will display files based on type
          directory----> /
          executable files-----> *
->ls -f :-It will disable the colors in terminal
->ls -i :-It will display all the files with Inode number
  note:-i-node represents address of the files and where files attrubutes are stored.

Below are the variuos file attributes
-----------------------------------------
1.Name of the file
2.The number of links to the file.
3.Size of the file
4.The owner
5.Creation time
6.Modified time
7.Last accessed time

->ls -lR :- It will display both main and sub directory files

->mkdir directory name:-It is used to create an directory.
->mkdir d1 d2 d3 :-It is used to create multiple directories.
->mkdir d1/d2 :-It is used to create directory inside another directory.
->mkdir -p d1/d2/d3
->rmdir directory name:- It is used to delete the directory(It will remove oly empty directories)
->rm -r <direct name> (To remove non-empty directories)
->touch filename :-It is used to create empty file
->cat > fileame with extension:- it is used to create file with content.
->cat filename with extension :- to print the content

Head:-
----------
It is used to show the top cotent in the file(default 10 lines will print)

->To print top 5 lines in the file
   head -n 10 filename with extension
->When we use minus then those line will exclude
   head -15 filename with extensionf

Tail:-
---------
It is used to show the bottom content in the file

->Tail command is used to read the log files
   tail filename with extenstion.(default botton 10 logs will print)
->Tail -n 10 file name with extension
->tail +2 filename with extension(It will start print from 2 line to till last line)
->tail -f filename with extension(It will print the live logs)

Word count:-
------------
We can count file data using word count command
  ->wc filename with extension

output:- 3   6      34
       lines words characters

->cp ->It is used to copy data from one file to another file we will use cp command
----
 cp oldfilename newfilename

If we want copy multiple files into single file then we go for "cat" command
 cat heros.txt heroins.txt > stars.txt

->mv :- It is used to rename the file or directory will use mv command
        mv f1.txt f11.txt
       By using mv command we can move the data from one directory to another directory
        mv f1.txt f2.txt

grep:- grep stands for global regular expression print
---------------------------------------------------------
->In linux OS we will use 'grep' command to search for text in file
    grep and states.txt
    grep -i and states.txt(-i will remove the case sensitive)

->To search particular text in multiple files then we execute command 
    grep -l 'ab' *

-->vi filename command is used to edit the text in the file.
   i :-Is used to change the mode from read to edit mode
   esc :- Is used to come out from the file
   :wq :-is for save file and quite
   :q! :-is for quit the file without save.

-->sed (Stream editor):- It is used to modified the specific word in the file
---------------------------
   Syntex:- sed 's/unix/linux' filename.extension

   The above command will modify only first occurance in each line

--> sed 's/unix/linux/2' filename.extention  (It will change it in the second occurance)
    sed 's/unix/linux/g' filename.extention  (It will replace it in all the places)

--> sed '3d' filename.extention (It is used to delete 3rd line in the file)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users and groups
------------------------------------------------------------------------
->Multiple users can access linux machine at a time.
->We can create multiple accounts in linux.

->Create an user in linux
--------------------------------
 sudo adduser <user-name>

->Deleting user in linux
--------------------------------
 sudo userdel <user-name>

->Switching the users
--------------------------
 su - <username>

->Groups
----------------
->Group means collection of users.
->The primary purpose of group is to define set of privileges for a given resource that can be shared among the users within the groups.

Creating a group in linux
----------------------------
 sudo groupadd <group-name>

Add user to group
----------------------
 sudo usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name>

To display existing groups
---------------------------
 cat /etc/group

To check user belongs to which groups
-------------------------------
 id <user-name>

Delete user from group
-----------------------
sudo gpasswd -d <user-name> <group-name>

Delete a group
----------------
sudo groupdel <group-name>


Difference between locate and find commands in linux
-----------------------------------------------------
->Locate and find commands are used for finding files/directories.

->In some linux distributions locate command may not work directly then we have to install it using below command
  sudo apt install mlocate

->Locate apache

Note:-Locate command will maintain it's own database and it will give results from it's database
    locate *.txt (It will give all text files available)
    locate -c *.txt (It will give count of text files available)

->Find command will search for files in linux file system
   find /home -name f1.txt
   find /tmp -type f -empty  (Find all empty files)
   find /tmp -type d -empty (find all empty directories)

->Note:-Performance wisw 'locate' will be faster than 'find' command but 'locate' command will not give results for newly created files/directories immediatly. If we want newly created results also then we have to update locate database.

man
--------------
Man command is used to get documentation of particular command.
 man locate ==>It will give locate command details.


Chown
--------------
It is used to change owner of the files.

  sudo chown newusername filename For users
  sudo chown user1 file1.txt

  sudo chown :groupname filename for groups
  sudo chown :user1 file1.txt

  sudo chown username:groupname <filename>

To switch to root user
----------------------------
sudo su

To check the processing 
----------------------------
Free

Installing Apache server in ubuntu
-------------------------------------
->Login to AWS.
->Create an EC2 instance (Ubuntu)
->Connect to EC2 instance using terminal
->Switch to root user account using(sudo su command)
->Update existing package in linux OS using below command
 -> sudo apt update
->Install apache2 server in linux machine usin below command
   sudo apt install apache2
->To check weather apache2 server installed or not
   apache -version
->To start apache2 server
    sudo systemctl start apache2
->To check the apache2 status
   sudo systemctl status apache2

Note:- Apache2 is an webserver and it is used to run the webapplications.
       Bydefault apache server will run in 8080 portnumber.
   By using winsip we can copy the fiels from windows to linux.
   In the below location we need to add our application.
  cat > /var/www/html/index.html
